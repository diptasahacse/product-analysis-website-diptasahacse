        "review": "I'm a fan of apple products and I like almost everything about this new MBA. But it has one huge flaw that nobody talks about. It's the camera hardware and it hasn't been updated in ages. My zoom calls are so grainy and bad even with decent light. A $1000 laptop with 10 year old front camera is unacceptable. Camera is very important to me. Especially now that we all are quarantined at home and making zoom calls all the time."

        "review": "The unit is smaller than the original Air, also it has NO USB ports, the description on the page is misleading and they never show the right-hand side of the unit in the pictures, otherwise, I would have never bought it, Amazon return policy is horrible they take 2 weeks to refund your money, took it out looked at it said nope, didn't even registered it. Waste of time and money."
